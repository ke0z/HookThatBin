# HookThatBin
A binary(malware) hooker using FRIDA (CLR) Dump your scripts on the scripts folder 
Nothing too fancy, code does what it needs to do, could be better maybe -\_(0-0)_/-
The video on this tweet explains pretty much what it does :)   https://x.com/ke_0z/status/1716991364544540685?s=46

More scripts are incoming (when I can dedicate some time): 
-Mobile Root Bypass
-DynamicReversing (by stalking through function calls)
-Exploit Development 

# Compiling 

Using VisualStudio, .NET4.8, Frida (frida-clr-16.1.10-windows-x86.dll.xz) or (frida-clr-16.1.10-windows-x86_64.dll.xz) as referenced DLLs tested with version 16.1.4-10 , copy the scripts folder to binary compiled location

# Running
